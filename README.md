# Local Development Task Dashboard

## Overview
<b>The Local Development Dashboard</b> is a desktop application that provides developers with a centralized view and control of their local development environment. 


It eliminates the need to switch between multiple terminal windows, database tools, and git clients by combining project management, service monitoring, git status tracking, database browsing, and log viewing in a unified interface

Developers working on multiple projects can instantly understand the state of their entire development environment, manage services with one-click controls, track git changes across all repositories, debug faster through centralized logs, and organize tasks alongside their projects
